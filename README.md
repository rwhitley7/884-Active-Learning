# Active Learning and Coresets

Modern technology has provided an enormous amount of data that can be utilized for machine learning applications. However, for supervised learning techniques, an increase in available data requires larger labeling power. For this reason, techniques such as Active Learning and Coresets have been heavily explored to reduce the cost of labeling and the time needed to train such models.
